# Twilio.Whatsapp_Automation
# WhatsApp Automation with Python and Twilio

Automate responses to incoming messages on a Twilio WhatsApp number using Python and the Twilio API. This project allows you to automatically respond with a predefined message when someone sends a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number.

## Overview

This project uses Python and the Twilio API to handle incoming messages on a Twilio WhatsApp number. When a message is received, the Python script responds with a customized message, informing the sender about your new WhatsApp number.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Twilio Python library (`twilio`)
- Flask (for local development, optional for deployment)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install twilio flask
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/whatsapp-automation.git
cd whatsapp-automation

 Configuration of Twilio Account:

Sign up for a Twilio account if you haven't already: Twilio Console
Obtain your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Dashboard.
Twilio WhatsApp Number:

Configure a Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox or use a purchased Twilio phone number for WhatsApp.
Webhook Setup:

Set up a webhook in the Twilio Console to forward incoming messages to your server's endpoint (/webhook).
Use ngrok for local testing or update to your server URL for deployment.
Python Script:

Update the app.py script with your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and WhatsApp number.
Customize the response message in the script as needed.
Usage
Running Locally
Start your Flask server locally:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Use ngrok to expose your local server to the internet for testing purposes:
bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5000
Update the webhook URL in the Twilio Console to point to your ngrok URL (http://your_ngrok_url.ngrok.io/webhook).
Deployment
Deploy your Flask application to a cloud server (e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2).

Update the webhook URL in the Twilio Console to point to your deployed server's URL (http://your_deployed_server_url/webhook).

Additional Notes
Security: Secure your webhook endpoint and credentials. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your script.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling in your script to manage potential issues.
Documentation: Refer to the Twilio API documentation for more advanced features and configurations.
